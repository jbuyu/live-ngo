                      Today most young people, despite being educated, encounter
                      difficulties in entering and remaining in the labor
                      market. For some, the transition to work is problematic.
                      Mismatches between skills and the labor market needs can
                      lead to long periods of job seeking, intertwined with
                      unemployment spells or periods of low skilled and
                      precarious work. However, if equipped with the relevant
                      skills needed in the labor market, there are possibilities
                      that the youth can be engaged in many areas of our
                      economy.
